## Email Template 1: Initial Inquiry

**Subject:** Patent Consultation Request - AI Code Generation Platform (Software Patent)

Dear [Attorney Name],

I am the founder/developer of **BharatBuild AI**, an AI-powered code generation platform that automatically creates, executes, and self-heals full-stack applications. I am seeking patent protection for several novel technical innovations in this system.

### About the Platform

BharatBuild AI is a production-ready platform similar to Bolt.new/Replit but with unique technical implementations including:

1. **Auto-Fix Orchestration System** - Automated error detection and self-healing across browser, build, backend, and container sources
2. **Multi-Technology Code Generation** - Supports 50+ technology combinations (React, Vue, FastAPI, Spring Boot, etc.)
3. **Scalable Preview Proxy Architecture** - Path-based routing enabling 100,000+ concurrent previews without port exhaustion

### What I'm Looking For

- Initial consultation to assess patentability
- Prior art search for top 3 innovations
- Filing provisional patent application in India
- Guidance on international filing strategy (US, PCT)

### Documentation Ready

I have prepared a detailed **Patent Innovation Document** (15 innovations, ~4,000 words) with:
- Technical descriptions and claims
- System architecture diagrams
- Key source code file references
- Prior art differentiation

### About Me

- Name: Kishore Udatha
- Location: [Your City], India
- Email: [Your Email]
- Phone: [Your Phone]

I would appreciate a 30-minute consultation call to discuss the patentability of these innovations and your fee structure.
