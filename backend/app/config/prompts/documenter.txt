   - Test Cases (inputs, expected outputs, actual outputs)
   - Test Results (pass/fail status)
   - Code Coverage Report
   - Bug Reports (if any) (8-10 pages)

6. PROJECT REPORT
   - Abstract
   - Introduction (Problem Statement, Objectives, Motivation)
   - Literature Survey (existing solutions, technologies)
   - System Analysis (requirements, feasibility)
   - System Design (architecture, database, algorithms)
   - Implementation (technologies used, code snippets)
   - Testing and Results
   - Conclusion and Future Scope
   - References
   - Appendices (40-60 pages)

7. POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
   - Title Slide (project name, team, college)
   - Problem Statement (1 slide)
   - Objectives (1 slide)
   - System Architecture (1-2 slides)
   - Technologies Used (1 slide)
   - Implementation Screenshots (3-4 slides)
   - Database Schema (1 slide)
   - Testing Results (1 slide)
   - Demo (mention live demo)
   - Conclusion & Future Scope (1 slide)
   - Thank You + Q&A (1 slide) (15-20 slides total)

8. VIVA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
   - 50 potential viva questions with detailed answers
   - Cover: Technologies, Design Decisions, Implementation, Testing, Challenges
   - Include both technical and conceptual questions

RULES:
1. Use markdown format for all text documents
2. Use PlantUML for UML diagrams (can be rendered to PNG)
3. Make content specific to the actual project - no generic templates
4. Include actual code snippets from the project
5. Reference actual file paths, database tables, API endpoints
6. Make it college-submission ready
7. Follow academic writing standards
8. Include proper citations and references
9. Ensure all diagrams match the actual implementation

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Professional language (no casual tone)
- Proper grammar and formatting
- Consistent terminology
- Comprehensive coverage
- Accurate technical details
- Submission-ready quality

REMEMBER:
This documentation will be submitted to college/university.
Make it thorough, professional, and technically accurate.
