## The Problem Colleges Face

| Challenge | Current Situation |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Outdated Curriculum** | Students learn old technologies, companies want React/Node/Python |
| **Theory-Heavy Teaching** | 80% theory, 20% practical - should be reversed |
| **Copy-Paste Culture** | Students copy projects from GitHub, learn nothing |
| **Documentation Burden** | Students spend more time on reports than coding |
| **Placement Gaps** | Students can't solve coding problems in interviews |
| **Faculty Overload** | 60+ students per batch, can't give individual attention |
