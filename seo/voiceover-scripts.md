---

#### [1:50 - 2:10] Coder Agent
> **"Now the Coder Agent takes over. Watch the code being written in real-time. It's creating React components, setting up API routes, designing the database schema. This would normally take days — it's happening in seconds."**

---

#### [2:10 - 2:25] Fixer Agent
> **"If there are any errors — and sometimes there are — the Fixer Agent automatically detects and fixes them. No manual debugging required."**
